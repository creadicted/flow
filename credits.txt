THANKS:
We dived in to flixel (flixel.org)  with almost no experience it was fun and we had help from various people and websites. 
Some part of the game is based on Cody Sandahls top-down RPG tutorial you can find here:

Also photonstorms tutorial about retro platform game was a big help especially the part about music and the DAME Editor part:

It broke less than we expected. Thank you Charles Goatley!
For music we used the  Underclocked (underunderclocked mix) from Eric Skiff (http://ericskiff.com/)

Special thanks for the chasing-carrots team that supported the GGJ and organized a great weekend. Thank you Patrick Wachowiak http://chasing-carrots.com and shackspace.de, where we had a nice time working on the project.
